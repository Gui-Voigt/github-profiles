## Author's comment

I'm working on this project as part of the selection process of the company Yeb market intelligence.

Although I already know some of the fundamentals of the Vue framework, this was my first opportunity to implement them in practice, in a real usability application.

I intend to continue the project as a way to continue studying the framework so that I can see the real impact of the concepts, libraries and the like that will build the application ecosystem.
